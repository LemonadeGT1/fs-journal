# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well: API's are new but they seem to be an easier concept to grasp than MVC was initially.

Surprise: I can't stop thinking about Zach's Scrum game and how to make the team more efficient

Struggle: My speed. I would like to pick up these concepts faster. Maybe my time away from coding has had a bigger effect than I had hoped.

Also, the giphy api was a pain.

Victory: Finishing the checkpoint before Sunday night!
