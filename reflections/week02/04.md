## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan for your application before starting to write the code?

less re-writing
faster coding (b/c you've already "gone over" it once)

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google
Instructors, T/A, co-workers, take a break

3. What coding mistakes would you be most likely to make? What advice from this article do you find most helpful?

not using source control is a mistake I've committed before, not taking breaks, and not writing tests

The programmers job is not to find a solution, it is to find the simplest solution that works correctly, performs adequately, but is still simple enough to read, understand, and maintain.
