# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Surprise: The team project taught me that you can't depend on Git to keep you from overwriting each others code. It requires a higher level of diligence.

Struggle: Still not 100% grasping the bootstrap positioning classes. I should make a cheat sheet. I should probably also create one for Git. 

Victory: Refactoring all of my code for the checkpoint. After getting the project functioning, I went through and rewrote a majority of the code, which used a fourth of the lines.
