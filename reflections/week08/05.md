# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?

First week of Capstone

Well: Working together to revamp our Figma

Surprise: We have a team of 5.

Struggle: making sure everyone is heard, and valued. One particular member of the team was not motivated by board games, so I hope to find things to keep him engaged/interested.

Victory: Even though we didn't start coding until Wednesday afternoon, we accomplished a lot by Friday.
