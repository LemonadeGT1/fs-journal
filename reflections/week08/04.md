## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit: This type of testing usually provides confidence in the robustness of the code tested

Component: this type of testing is for evaluating the input/output of the application

End-to-End: This type of testing is a way to make sure that applications behave as expected and that the flow of data is maintained for all kinds of user tasks and processes

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Unit testing may be most useful because developers are still working in the code and can easily make changes according to test results

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

component testing. Unit testing is the most granular, and end-to-end covers the overall application, so component testing seems like a middle ground that could be covered by one or the other.
