## Questions

1. What is a **nested route***?

a rout that is contained within another route - think sub-page

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

for example a page dedicated to baseball, a rout may be needed for each team, which could in turn have a route for each player

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

I don't see why not. what if you had a store with several departments, you might rout through the dept to a specific item.
