# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well: I had a lot of fun with this weeks team lab - more fun than usual

Surprise: after removing all the logger.log's, how few lines of code it really takes to interact with the api's

Struggle: I think I still need some more work on v-model's. Also, it seems to take longer to debug vue - maybe I just made logic errors, more so than syntax errors this week

Victory: finally debugging the checkpoint.
