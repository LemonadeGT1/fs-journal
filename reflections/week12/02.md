# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? Are you working from client -> server or focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Fairly steady day, though I feel I'm a little on the slow side at this point.

managing stress? going to bed now.

Worried that I won't be able to get it done in the timeline I set for myself.
