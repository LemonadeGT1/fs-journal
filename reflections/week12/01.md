# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Today has gone well. Struggled with Masonry, but got it set up now. 

I keep going from front end to back end. This has helped me to feel less stress b/c I have something to show for my time, as opposed to doing all the back end first and not being able to show anything.

I'd really like this to be in place by Thursday night, so that Friday is finesse, and stretch goals.
