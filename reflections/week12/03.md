# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is your Vue application shaping up? Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

I think I missed this yesterday. Yes client going well. Moments are UP and moments are DOWN, though overall progressing.
