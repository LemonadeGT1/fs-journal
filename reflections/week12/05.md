# Final Reflection
The final week, the final day of coursework. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Final! it went well. My original goal was to have it passing by Thursday evening, so I missed that by a couple of hours. Glad it's done. I hope career week feels better, or at least has less pressure.
