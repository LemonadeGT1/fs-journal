# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Well: SQL goes well, as does C#.

Surprise: thinking about how it's been 9 years since I did type of programming last.

Struggle: Dapper syntax is still a little bit of a guess to me. Getting through Postman tests / errors can be a challenge at times

Victory: overcoming postman
