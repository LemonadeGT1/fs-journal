> **ðŸ“– [C# Data Types](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/01-CSharp-Generics)**

## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

value: directly contain their values

reference: stores the reference to where the value is stored

pointer: holds the memory address of another type or variable.

How they are stored in memory is a main difference


2. What are the ***value-type*** data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort

They are numbers, except for struct's.

3. In your own words how do ***reference types*** get stored in memory? How does this differ from value types?

Reference types store the address of the location of the value being stored, referencing a specific space in memory.

Value types store the actual value.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I think things went well today, except for the late notification about when class started, which almost no one saw. Anyway, c# is going to be awesome. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's lesson and SQL.
