> **ðŸ“– [C# Enums](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums)**

## Questions

1. What is an ***Enum***, and what are some use cases for them?

They are strongly typed constants. They could be used to represent things like North, South, East, West, which would be easier than working with 0, 1, 2, 3 mapped to the same values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

member = value

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (if you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

I have not used enums yet. I can envision using them in drop-down lists, or other groups of common items.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I'm sure Enum's can be a useful / powerful tool. I think that with a table of random items they may be just the thing.
