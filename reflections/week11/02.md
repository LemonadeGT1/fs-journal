## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `FOREIGN KEY`

Primary key is the unique identifier on the table its self, the Foreign key points to another table

2. What is an ***alias***? 

It can be used in place of writing out the the full table name

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
Well, that third table has the same name as the first, but it looks like it's supposed to be the many to many relationship table, so, I would have called it something like DPRelations.

SELECT p.*, d.*
FROM patients p
JOIN DPRelations dp ON p.id = dp.patientId
JOIN doctors d ON dp.doctorId = d.id
