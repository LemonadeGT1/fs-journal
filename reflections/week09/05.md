# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well: Each member of the team finds things to work on without needing to be told what to do

Surprise: Sockets could be quite simple to implement - let me emphasize could. it doesn't seem to require a ton of additional code

Struggle: I suspect the hackathon will be a struggle, not because it won't be fun, but because of fighting off a cold at the same time

Victory: We will have a legit project when this is all done!
