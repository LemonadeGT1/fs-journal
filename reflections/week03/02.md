## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***Encapsulation***?

bringing data and functions into one component

2. What were some of the problems with ***closures*** and the ***underscore prefix*** convention?

This is interesting. A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. Too many closures can slow down your application.

by convention the underscore prefix is meant to indicate a 'private' variable, which may lead to a "false sense" of privacy.

3. How do we create private variables in an ES6 `Class`? Why would you do this? 

with a # prefix

to keep grubby hands off your variables! or at least make the system throw a syntax error when trying to access them from outside the object.
