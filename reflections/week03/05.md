# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well: I think the checkpoint went well this week. It seemed to take less time than some of the earlier labs - likely due to being more familiar with the errors.

Surprise: MVCS is a little more mentally taxing than expected.

Struggle: just hoping I can keep up.

Victory: Finished the checkpoint well before Sunday night!
