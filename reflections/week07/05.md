# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Well: the pacing of the tower project. it definitely took some after-hours work to accomplish but it was a pretty steady flow

Surprise: tower was due first thing Friday morning

Struggle: thinking I had additional hours when suddenly I didn't

Victory: got it done before lunch, a bit earlier than the original plan
