it can be especially useful when collaborating with others.

low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, high-fidelity

completion of each should be considered an opportunity to determine if the project is still going the right direction.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Totally worth the effort. they can be shown to clients to make sure you've captured their vision for the site, without having to code/re-code everything.
