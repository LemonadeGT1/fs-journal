# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Surprise learn of the week - it really is very useful to focus on mobile first. I finally tried this for the checkpoint, and it has made a great difference.

This week has gone very well. My biggest personal challenge is a little frustration with bootstraps naming convention for positioning of elements. It seems to me it would have made more sense to use top/middle/bottom for vertical actions, and left/center/right for horizontal. Personal preference. Not a deal breaker by any means.

Overall, week 1 is a win!

Thanks
